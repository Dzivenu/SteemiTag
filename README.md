# SteemiTag
A tool for Steemit which helps users distribute their votes automatically according to their preferences.

## Version
This is SteemiTag v0.2.0.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Steem library for Python](https://github.com/steemit/steem-python)
* Windows OS (cross-platform compatibility is uncertain)

### Manual
1. Compile the program using Python 3 (optimally 3.5+).
2. Create a password for internal use of SteemiTag (see [guildlines for passwords](http://its.virginia.edu/accounts/passwords.html)).
3. Set configuration (i.e. check options you want to choose, select authors and tags you would like to vote for).
4. Write your login and paste your [posting key](https://steemit.com/security/@noisy/what-is-the-difference-between-a-password-and-a-private-key-s-on-steemit-how-to-make-your-account-more-secure-by-using-them).
5. Provided your credentials are correct, the program will start running. You can have a coffee in the meantime or simply minimize it and let it work in the background.
6. To check its effectiveness after a given period of time you may go to [steemd.com/@your_nick](http://steemd.com/@haiyangdeperci).

## Proceed with caution
Please be aware the program may drain your voting power quickly as the preventive mechanics is not available yet.
Also, by providing wrong information (e.g. incorrect usernames of authors you want to endorse) to SteemiTag you risk crashing it. If that happens try deleting ***storage* folder** in the SteemiTag's main directory.
